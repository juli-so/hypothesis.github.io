#### The Charge:
> ...lay out the steps forward for Hypothes.is as a product, development and services organization to take in order to optimize it's software, it's organization, the way it communicates and carries itself in order to best encourage the uptake of its products and services by, and community contributions from the widest possible audience of developers, website owners, users, etc.

## What Success Looks Like
Developers everywhere building Open Annotation Data Model (and other output from the W3C Annotations WG) into All The Things--ideally via Hypothes.is code (& ephimera) that they are actively collaborating on.

All The Things === The Web, Browsers, Document Viewers, File Formats, Anything with Reference-able Stuff (even stuff IRL).

### To Optimize:
In order to "best encourage the uptake of its products and services by, and community contributions from the widest possible audience of developers, website owners, users, etc.

#### Its Software (or ones we depend on and participate in):
* h
  * noted
* AnnotatorJS
* Document (currnetly PDF.js) Viewer + h--aka via.hypothes.is

##### Catalogue
* annotation systems shipping Open Annotation representations (RDFa, JSON-LD, other)
* CMS's shipping
  * embed.js embedding
  * Open Annotation Data Model publishing support
  * AnnotatorJS + integration with the CMS's storage
* general Open Annotation Data Model tooling / converters / renderers
  * browser extensions
  * exporters
  * APIs / web scrapers / wrappers
* communities interested in annotation
  * IndieWeb
  * W3C
  * sub-groups inside browser orgs
  * academic groups
* other implementations of annotation (and their licensing)
  * not necessarily (or currently) doing OA
* developers interest in annotation
  * who are developing something
  * who are speaking on the topic
  * who are advocating for annotation
* applications (off the Web) currently generating annotations
  * Web or Browser-based viewers of those formats
  * ..and whether they support annotation display / editing
* media types with fragement identifier support
* content management APIs with some "concept" of annotation OR abstract enough to support them

##### Metrics
* who's using h, noted, AnnotatorJS, Open Annotation
  * press coverage
  * software using
  * developers posting about
* how many contributors to h, AnnotatorJS
  * employees
  * non-employees
  * active
  * inactive
* mailing lists (h, AnnotatorJS, & Open Annotation)
  * subscribers
  * participants (have send mail)
  * frequency
  * topics (bugs, features, future)
* what's modular--on npm, pypy, or just `script src=""`-able
* usage overhead
  * time
  * dependencies
  * languages (JS, CoffeeScript, HTML, CSS, Python, ElasticSearch)
* time to useable from zero
  * ex: `embed.js` is < 10 minutes
  * ex: `h` is > an hour--depending on platform

#### Its Organization
* Contributing Guide
* Progress Reporting
  * celebrate the small wins
  * understand our scope
  * aim for the nearest horizons
  * don't *only* dream about the future
* understand and document our decision making / collaboration processes

#### Its Communications & Carriage
* regular cadence of
  * blog posts
  * events
  * press coverage
  * demos
  * announce@ list posts
  * tweets
* documentation
  * what it is / does
  * how (and where) to run / use it
  * who's it for
  * how to customize it
* people
  * who knows what
  * who to talk to about
  * who's "into" what (identifiers, CMSs, history, acadamia, etc)

##### Metrics
* how frequent are in posts, events, press, etc
* does the project have tests?
  * coverage (and badge)
* does it have docs?
  * are they hosted / visible?
  * per version?
  * docs "coverage"?
* visitors
* sign-ups
* readers
* reviewers / annotators
  * are we blogged about?
  * are we tweeted about?
* what's our events coverage?
  * press / blog / social coverage of our events
  * what events are we at
    * who
    * how often
    * did we speak?
* most popular
  * posts
  * pages
  * topics / tags
