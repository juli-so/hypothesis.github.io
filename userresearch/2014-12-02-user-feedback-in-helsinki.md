### 1: Student (HCI), 20s

-   Did not expect having to activate the account; logging in failed without clear reason ([#1660](https://github.com/hypothesis/h/issues/1660) solved)
-   Expect to be able to click ‘only me’ lock icon to make annotation public
-   Expect icon to show presence of annotations when plugin not activated
-   Clicking an annotation should show its location in the page ([#1634](https://github.com/hypothesis/h/issues/1634) solved)

### 2: Student (ML), 20s

-   When hovering a highlight, expect to see the annotation pop up
-   Clicking an annotation should show its location in the page ([#1634](https://github.com/hypothesis/h/issues/1634) solved)

### 3: Student/Researcher (ML), 20s

-   Uses highlighting to bookmark sentences, using stream to find them back, using tagging to group them.
-   Not comfortable sharing thoughts with the whole world, but maybe groups or sharing is nice.
-   Would like button to share directly to email/facebook/twitter/to one person ([#122](https://github.com/hypothesis/h/issues/122))

### 4: Student (ML), App developer/entrepreneur, 20s

##### UI feedback:

-   User should be notified more prominently about presence of annotations.
-   The text itself should be subtly augmented to show annotation presence, instead of tabs on the side (eyes are on the text).
-   Extension icon should show when there are annotations on the current page, to not forget it’s there. Would enable it constantly.
-   Selection should be editable to correct mistakes.
-   Highlighting mode should turn off after creating one highlight (but did not know selecting already works without highlighting mode)
-   Hovering the speech bubble icon to get a menu is annoying
-   Spaces don’t separate tags. Was not clear, had to learn this by trial and error.

##### Use case feedback:

-   Dream use case: TLDR’s of the web
-   Private/Public:
	-   Likes public, no interest in private annotations; share and read thoughts.
	-   Default is private, makes some sense, but should be able to change default.

-   Page comments:
	-   Annotates the title to write a TLDR, seems logical.
	-   Page comments seem an okay idea, he already discovered the button for them.
	-   But would still annotate the title instead of using page comments.

-   Tags:
	-   Uses tags to tag the topics of the article, seems more logical (for his TLDR).
	-   Stream without search filters is useless, too much (uninteresting) stuff.
	-   Annotation is too broad. We should wrap and market it around a very
    simple use case, for everyone to know and understand what it is
    about. Maybe allow other use cases aside, but focus on one or two.
    For example TLDR’s or [citation needed] (referring to my own
    suggestion)

### 5: Researcher (ML), 20s

-   Can I let people comment on a text I have? Can I restrict the set of people?
-   Is there a tutorial? (before installing it)
-   Sign in / create account are confusing
-   Activating account leads to the stream; what’s this? where did the tutorial go?
-   how to enable it (what’s location bar?)
-   When going to an annotation (via shared link), I want to see it in context of the original page. Key feature. ([vision\#87](https://github.com/hypothesis/vision/issues/87))
-   Can I subscribe/follow people? For example my research group?
-   Did not see how to know whether there are annotations.
-   Use case: would like to see annotations for scientific papers.
-   Fine if it works on demand, need not always be enabled. Enable/disable per tab is okay.
-   Use case: to let people review my own text.
-   Did not notice pop up menu.
-   Why different types of yellow? (creepy dark yellow!)
-   Will only work for scientific communities, other people will
    probably write stupid things like what happens in normal comments.

### 6: Student/Researcher, 20/30s

-   I need to open this every time to see if anybody commented on this page?
-   Not interested in using; don’t ever comment or read comments
-   I usually read on mobile device
-   But on mobile, people don’t use browsers, but read in apps


### Gerbens observations from seeing users interacting:

-   Selection in page disappears when writing an annotation, can we highlight it already?
-   Weird flow: Create account -\> activate -\> login (why?) -\> stream (why?)
-   Can we either skip activation or log in automatically upon activation (and please show the welcome page or nothing at all)?
