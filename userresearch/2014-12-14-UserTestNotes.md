### Graduate Student (Physics), 20’s:

[Full Video Link](http://youtu.be/fkwRnYaHqBI): note, where relevant in the notes I will try to link to time codes in the video so you don’t have to watch the whole thing, only the most relevant parts.

**Annotation Habits:** Does not currently annotate.

**[Typical Day in the Life of a Phd Student/Scientist]()**: User provided some insight into his day to day activities.
-	Wake up
-	Read emails
-	Do research (data analysis on his computer)
-	Read articles, he needs to keep up with what is published in the field. His advisor sends him articles he should read. This was the area that he was most excited about using hypothes.is with, especially once the group feature is built. After the test he continued talking about this with me.

**Other Collaborative Research Tools:** Uses Google Scholar to find new articles. Uses GitHub to exchange programs with other physicists.

## Topics that came up:

### Homepage
Looking at the homepage it wasn’t quite obvious to the user what exactly hypothes.is was. He saw from the features list that it had something to do with annotating, commenting, and tagging, but he didn’t quite grasp what it was.

The first thing he clicked on was the link to the “What is it?” page.

### Welcome page
Aside from the double embedding which has already been addressed there were few problems. The user intuitively grasped being able to click on a highlight and see corresponding cards.

### Sharing
Share Dialogue needs work. It needs to close when clicking outside of it. [The user was clicking around the share box and was confused that he couldn’t close it](http://youtu.be/fkwRnYaHqBI?t=4m18s). Also the icon that links to the standalone page made little sense to him.

### Making an Annotation
No problems.


### Confusion over different types of notes
The confusion seemed to steam from the different kinds of notes, comments, and highlights and slightly misunderstanding what the difference between them was (user was not able to explain this correctly). However, after a brief explanation he seemed to grasp things a bit better.

### Highlight Mode
There was also a bit of confusion when highlight mode was toggled because the other annotations disappeared. User was not sure why. Overall, we didn’t focus on it too much. User said that he, ‘doesn’t highlight while reading,’ so the highlight tool was of less interest to him. 

### Show Annotations
User thought the icon made sense for the action of showing and hiding (seeing or not seeing) highlights.

### Toolbar Confusion
It is hard for the user to know if a toolbar button is on or off. We can be much clearer by having the color explicitly change when clicking on it. Currently, it just moves a bit which is not sufficient. This [confused the user](http://youtu.be/fkwRnYaHqBI?t=12m20s), who suggested the icon color should change.

### Click on lock to change privacy
User expected to be able to change an annotations visibility settings by clicking on the lock. Might be interesting to explore this.

### Reading Annotations (Voting / Moderation Feature Request)
Reading annotations was very intuitive. However, user immediately started to wonder what the experience would be like if there were hundreds of annotations. He asked, ‘if there are hundreds of annotations, how do you rank them?’ He was interested in seeing moderation and organizational tools to help him find the best content, especially because the WSJ climate change article we were looking at delt with an issue that was very divisive.

### More Profile Information needed
While reading the WSJ climate change article and annotations, I asked the user, “Who do you think the people making these annotations are?” To which he responded, ‘previous user testers.’ The annotations were actually made by scientists with Phds in climate science, but there was really no way to glean that information from clicking on the user name or looking at the card.

### User is more interested in reading comments from experts
After finding out the annotators were experts in the field we had a tangent where user talked about some of the problems with comments on the internet as they are today (poor quality, spam, difficulty addressing specific parts of the text, etc.). In the course of this conversation he mentioned: “I would be more interested in reading comments from a group of experts.” He wondered what this would look like for disciplines outside of science.

### User was pleased to hear of PDF support
As a scientist, many of the articles he deals with are in PDF.

### Stream [[video at 29m28s](http://youtu.be/fkwRnYaHqBI?t=29m28s)]
‘Since things on the stream can be about any topic it would be cool if I could filter the stream according to topics I’m interested in.’

User wanted a way to filter conversation on the stream so that it would be relevant to him. Rather than a firehose, he wanted something that was a bit more like Reddit, where here could see annotations related to certain topics coming from all over the web.

### Groups feature request
He was also very interested in private groups which he thought would be great for his research group. After the test he noted, "groups would be great for scientific research."

### Math + LaTeX
Since user is a scientist that deals with equations in his work, I took the opportunity to go over using math. He was familiar with using $$ enclosed math $$ but noted that usually for inline Math on most sites he would use $ enclosed math $. Overall, he was okay with it noting, “it’s slightly different, but every text editor has it’s own way of including math.” Additionally, he noticed/used the markdown button.
