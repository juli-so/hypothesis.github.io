### Graduate Student (HCI), 20’s

Annotation Habbits:

-   Annotates PDFs a lot, uses Apple’s Preview a lot, doesn’t like it
    for the most part.
    -   He does like how he can choose the color of the highlight and sticky
    notes (he likes to color code things).
    -   He doesn’t like that there are some interoperability problems with
    notes made with Apple Preview. If he shares the files (he grades
    papers a lot), he can’t be certain that people who don’t have macs
    will be able to see them displayed correctly (and has had problems
    with this). “If you don’t have Apple Preview, the annotations either
    don’t show up at all or they are in an ugly sticky note that doesn’t
    display correctly all the time.”
-   Used a chrome extension for PDF annotation when he had a Chromebook,
    but couldn’t remember which one.

Other collaborative or research tools:

-   Uses Zotero for managing his bibliographies and exporting and
    importing them.
-   IPython Notebooks.
-   He also uses Readability and was curious if Hypothes.is annotations
    made in Readability would also be visable on the actual articles; it
    doesn’t as Readability does not use rel=cononical.

Features requested:

-   Direct-linking: He wants to be taken to the page with the annotation
    in context. The link to the page was clearly not enough, as he also
    had to load the extension on the page and find the original
    annotation that he was looking at in the stream.

## Topics that came up:

### Chrome Store Permissions {.c0}

Seemed a little taken aback by the permissions the Chrome Extension
asked for:

-   Change your settings that control websites access to cookies,
    JavaScript, and Plugins

-   “Why can it change my settings that control websites access to
    cookies? Is it going to make me accept cookies when I don’t want to
    because I would hate that.”

-   Read and change all your data on the websites you visit.

-   “It seems fine but it feels kind of creepy, but whatever I’m going
    to add it because I know Jake and I trust him...”

### Location bar

When installing the extension, he clicked the hypothes.is button in the
location bar as he was being redirected to the welcome page. It removed
the extension, and he was curious why the extension wasn’t loaded on the
welcome page.

“Enable the sidebar via the button in the location bar.”

-   “I don’t know what the location bar is, but I see the sidebar so I
    am going to ignore that.”
-   Suggestion: We might want have a picture or icon so that it is
    clearer what is being referred to.

### Sharing

Editing, deleting, and replying to annotations were very intuitive, he
started using these features before even being instructed to. However,
on the share dialog, he didn’t like how he had to select the text
himself.

He wanted a quick way to copy the link. He also wanted confirmation that
the link had been copied. He expected the button next to the link in the
share box to copy the text.

Additionally, he expected to be able to easily close the “share thing”
by clicking elsewhere on the annotation. Currently, to close the share
box you need to click on the share magicbutton again.

He liked being able to see the link, since it explained to him that
there was a URL associated with the comment which was “useful
information,” and something he ‘wouldn’t have understood right away.’

### Tabs

User didn’t really like the tabs at first, and was confused by them at
first, though he was able to accurately explain their purpose and what
they were doing. Though he insisted that it was confusing, “I’m not
really clear on what these numbers mean [clicks on tabs]. Like, I kind
of get that it’s the number of annotations but I’m not really sure
that’s the case.”

The up and down tabs confused him for a moment, and he questioned their
necessity.

“I like the way that it [the tabs] moves, but the numbers don’t seem
totally relevant. They also keep changing [user scrolls down and the up
tap goes from 3 to 6]... I get that it means there are 6 annotations
above but the numbers don’t seem totally relevant.” Later he said, “I
don’t need to know how many there are.” He suggested we have tabs but
only show the numbers on hover.

He didn’t like the numbers on the tabs. “The numbers are confusing, and
I don’t like numbers.” He didn’t mind that there were tabs thought.
Later, during the summary questions, he reiterated that he liked
navigating with the tabs, but didn’t like the numbers.

### The Highlight Tool

User was not a big fan of the highlight mode. He specifically didn’t
like that Highlight mode automatically highlights stuff. He hates the
same feature in Apple Preview, “Because then I’m always turning it off
and on.” During questions after the test he reiterated, “It stressed me
out that I couldn’t just highlight text without actually highlighting on
the page. The way I read is by highlighting stuff and reading it,
highlighting stuff and reading it.”

He made a point of explaining that he often reads by selecting text.

I had him annotate a web page of his choosing, and when it came to
making highlights he accidentally made one and had difficulty undoing.
“Oooopps, I didn’t mean to annotate that and now I can’t undo.” He tried
a number of things:

-   Keyboard shortcuts for undo.
-   Hovering over the highlight
-   Right-clicking on the highlight
-   Clicking on the highlight.

He eventually figured it out, but it wasn’t intuitive or easy for him.
He made another accidental highlight (selecting the entire page).

He liked how the adder works for creating new annotations and wanted
something similar for the highlights.

### The Toolbar

User wasn’t sure what the plus button was for even though he described
its purpose perfectly. “Why don’t they just select some text and put
their comment there?”

He liked having a quick handy way of toggling highlight visibility.

### Reading annotations

We navigated to the Wall Street Journal article [Climate Science is not
Settled](http://online.wsj.com/articles/climate-science-is-not-settled-1411143565
).
The extension took FOREVER to load on the page.

Once again he found the tabs confusing. There were multiple down tabs on
the page, and he found that confusing. He reiterated many things he said
earlier about the tabs.

I suggested he toggle show annotations, and he was much happier. He
greatly preferred navigating the article with show annotations on:

-   “Yeah, this is way nicer. I didn’t even know this was an option.”
-   “This way of navigating is much more intuitive for me.”
-   He liked how he could click on the highlights and see the
    corresponding annotations in the sidebar.
-   He liked how he could click on the page and easily close the
    sidebar.

He liked reading the notes. “They are clearly schooling the guy who
wrote this foolish article.”

### The Stream

Came across bug
[\#1712](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhypothesis%2Fh%2Fissues%2F1712&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF_zPeN8e7D6BHsDMvVtabvWvOU5g),
a reply didn’t have a link to its parent.

-   “What are they annotating? What’s going on?”

User saw an annotation on Moby-dick but it was an annotation made off
localhost, so he wasn’t able to access it.

He easily understood all of the concepts behind the stream, and
explained them to me correctly.

-   “These are all the things that have been annotated.”’

### Changing Account Password

User had scrolled fairly deeply into the stream. I asked, “Imagine you
need to change your password, how would you do this?” He correctly, went
to the username menu and selected account. Nothing happened. He did it
again, nothing happened. He was a little confused because he didn’t see
the account card that had appeared at the top of the stream.
