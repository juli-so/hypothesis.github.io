To grow a healthy product born from our project, we need to understand how
people are using it, what they expect from it, and what they hope to gain from
its use.

To do that, we are exploring the following metrics and Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs).

Metrics & KPIs:

* Hypothes.is Accounts
  * total
  * with annotations
  * without annotations
  * with page comments
* URLs being annotated
  * top 5 URLs
  * top 5 domains
* Tags being used
  * top 5 most used
  * full tag cloud / space
* Annotation bodies
  * largest (char count)
  * smallest (char count)
  * # that contain links
