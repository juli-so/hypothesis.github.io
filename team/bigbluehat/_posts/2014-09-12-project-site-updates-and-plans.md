I've dug into Jekyll, and am pretty happy with how things have gone so far.
There's something about the static-ness of it all that feels refreshing.
:smiley_cat:

Site orangization is till in progress, but the plan at the moment is for team
members to put their work/hacking logs into `team/{name}/_posts`. They'll show
up on the main posts list--and attributed if you add `author: {name}` in the
YAML front matter--and on your personal posts list at `/team/{name}/`.

Here's [my index of posts](http://{{ site.domain }}{{ site.baseurl }}/team/bigbluehat/) for reference.

Most everything is Markdown. What isn't is HTML.

Enjoy! :tada:
